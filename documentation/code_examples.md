# MiSnap SDK v5.4.1 Code Examples

The MiSnap SDK provides several code examples that can be used as reference while you integrate the SDK, 
these code examples are located in the `examples/` directory and cover a wide range of integration 
options.

While the examples are self-explanatory, we strongly recommend reading the in-code documentation for more details and the full APIs for a better understanding.

# Code Examples

The following is a summary of the included code example directories and their demonstration purposes.

* `examples/activity/` demonstrates how to integrate the MiSnap SDK using an `Activity` based integration, which is the ***most recommended*** way of integrating the SDK.
* `examples/advanced/` demonstrates an advanced combined workflow integration hosted in a custom `Activity` and retaining the navigation control.
* `examples/advanced/screens` demonstrates how to provide the MiSnap SDK with a custom `navgraph` for various use cases.
* `examples/camera/` demonstrates how to query the device's camera support and how to integrate and use the `CameraView`.
* `examples/fragment/` demonstrates how to integrate the MiSnap SDK using the built-in fragments for single-activity architecture applications.
* `examples/misnapview/` demonstrates how to integrate and use the `MiSnapView` for custom UI/UX integrations.
* `examples/science/` demonstrates how to directly interface with the different MiSnap SDK sciences to analyze frames, read NFC chips, get device metadata, record and analyze speech.
* `examples/serverconnection/` demonstrates how to use the results of a session to build an HTTP request payload that can be used with supported Mitek's APIs.
* `examples/settings/` demonstrates how to customize the UI and behavior of the MiSnap SDK.
* `examples/views/` demonstrates how to use the different android `View`s included in the MiSnap SDK's `workflow` module to create a flexible UI/UX integration.
* `examples/workflowhandler/` demonstrates an advanced combined workflow integration hosted in a custom `Activity` that delegates the navigation control to the MiSnap SDK.

Please see the in-code documentation for more details and the full APIs used in the examples.
